The article focuses on the problems of knowledge-intensive products assembly quality in aircraft engine industry. A mathematical model has been proposed to determine optimal conditions for mating assembly units of a low-pressure compressor (LPC) rotor of an aircraft engine. Parameters optimized include relative angular positions of parts in the rotor. Three optimization criteria have been considered: assembly geometry; imbalance value and integral criterion combining both above criteria. The model has been implemented in the MATLAB system. The calculations have been made using actual part models created based on measurements of the LPC parts geometry. The best optimization criterion has been selected.
The location parameters of the actual profile of the blades of a gas turbine engine relative to its nominal position are used to assess the quality of these parts manufacture. The complex shape of the aerodynamic surfaces of the blades, as well as the errors in their manufacture make it difficult to unambiguously determine the displacement and rotation of the actual profile. The use of various methods for calculating the parameters under consideration may result in mismatching values, which raises the question of a reasonable choice of the methods used. This paper presents two methods for determining the geometric parameters of the location of the aerodynamic profiles of the blades, taking into account the features of their manufacture and the requirements of the existing industry standard. Also, the work evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed methods in determining the processing parameters of the blades of a gas turbine engine.
Geometric deviations of parts surfaces inevitably occur during parts manufacture. It is known that the accumulated defects of parts surfaces and assembly units impact their functional characteristics throughout the entire product life cycle. Often, assembly simulation and dimensional ties analysis of products are performed by using the nominal geometry of parts without taking into account geometric deviations of the shape and location of parts surfaces. The accuracy of dimensional analysis without taking into account geometric deviations of the shape and location of parts surfaces is not sufficient to solve technological problems in digital production. The purpose of this article is the study of the influence of methods and models for constructing the real geometry on the accuracy of its reproduction. The subject of the research is the assembly unit of the rotor of a low-pressure turbine of an aircraft engine.

Comparative results of assembly simulation with the use of considered methods of real geometry constructing are presented, as well as their influence on the controlled assembly parameters is estimated.

The manufacturing errors of the turbine rotor lead to the occurrence of vibrations that limit the acceptable modes of operation of aircraft engines. In order to reduce such vibrations, the current manufacturing technology of the rotor contains a complex procedure for balancing it.

The quality of aircraft and rocket engines depends primarily on the geometric accuracy of assembly units and parts. Mathematical models implemented in the form of computer models are used to predict quality indicators (in particular, assembly parameters). Direct modeling of the conjugation process using numerical conjugation and finite-element models of assemblies requires significant computational resources and is often accompanied by problems convergence of solutions. In order to solve the above problems, it is possible to use neural network models describing the main regularities of the pairing process based on the accumulated results.

To predict the quality parameters of products (in particular, the assembly parameters) mathematical models were implemented in the form of computer models. To ensure the adequacy of calculations, it is necessary to have information about the actual geometry of the parts, which can be obtained using noncontact measurements of parts of the assembly. As a result of measuring parts and components using optical or laser scanner, a large dimension array of measured points is formed. After standard processing (e.g. noise removal, combining the scans, smoothing, creating triangulation mesh), the recognition of individual surfaces of parts becomes necessary. This paper presents a neural network model that allows the recognition of elements based on an array of measured points obtained by scanning.
The prediction models of assembly processes for critical parts will enable ensuring adaptive control of assembly based on the measured information. Direct simulation of the mating process with employing computational mating models and finite element models of assemblies requires considerable computational resources and is frequently accompanied by the solution convergence problem. To solve the above problems, neural network models may be employed, which describe basic regularities for the mating process based on the cumulative results. The work describes the technique for predicting the mating precision of parts based on real geometric models of surfaces. Real models of parts represents dot arrays of their surfaces. The technique employs the developed model, allowing to calculate the assembly geometric parameters of parts. The results of mating simulation for the disk and the spacer of the turbine rotor are considered. To predict the parameter of "radial run-out" depending on the value and nature of form deviation and tension of mating surfaces, a radial-base neural network was developed and trained.
Among the complex profile components of modern gas turbine engines, special attention is paid to the impellers and its blades, and their surfaces have the most strict requirements for geometric precision. At the present time, additive technologies are becoming increasingly widespread, through which it is possible to obtain complex shape parts in a short time with minimal post-processing. However, the process of selective laser melting (SLM) is accompanied by a constantly changing redistribution of temperature stresses in the fusion zone and in the entire part, which can lead to significant deflections of geometry. The authors propose a technique that allows reducing the drawbacks that occurs during the printing process. The technique is based on the use of computer simulation of the selective laser process for predicting deflections and subsequent pre-correction of the input triangulation model by moving the nodes of its surfaces. Based on the results of the approbation, control and analysis of the batch parts obtained by SLM, an additional algorithm for compensating for discrepancies that exist due to instability of the process was implemented with MATLAB.
In CAM-systems (Computer-aided manufacturing), it is possible to simulate the process of measurement by the machine and coordinate measuring machine and generate measurement commands in the control program. Measurements can become the basis for the implementation of various adaptive processing schemes. The main advantage is an ability to adjust automatically the machining process basing on the measurement results without removing the parts from the machine. During measuring complex parts (stamps, engine blades) by the machine and coordinate measuring machine, measurement uncertainties significantly increase. It is not calculated in modern CAM-systems (for example, NX from SIEMENS and CATIA from Dassault Systemes). This feature can lead to a degradation of processing precision (due to inadequate measurement accuracy) with program seemed definitive. The paper proposes a model and a software module for the prediction of measurement uncertainties, implemented with use of the NX OPEN API, which can be integrated into the CAM module.
The measurement results for the geometric parameters of complex surfaces largely depend on the measurement parameters. The different processing algorithms for measurement results implemented in the coordinate measuring machine software gives different values for the mentioned parameters. In this paper, a model for estimating the measurement errors in the geometric parameters of complex surfaces caused by the use of different result processing tools is considered. The represented work consists of several stages: development of surfaces with a known deviation of form and location, simulation of the coordinate measurement process, calculation of target parameters in software of coordinate measuring machines and analysis of simulation results. The model was tested through the example of determining the measurement error in the involute surfaces of tooth wheels. The represented model may be used to determine the optimal measurement parameters for geometric parameters of complex surfaces.

Use of this model makes it possible to obtain interval estimates of errors with the required confidence level of probability and mathematical expectation. The relations of the probabilistic error estimates at any of the measured points on surface are obtained.
One of the parameters for determining the quality of manufacturing of coordinate measuring machines (CMM) is the measurement error achieved by using these machines. Obtaining an estimate of measurement error based on practical experiments is a complex task. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of the measurement process on a coordinate measuring machine. The model is implemented on the basis of a dimensional chain and takes into account the influence of the main sources of systematic errors of CMM. Multiple modeling of the measurement process with the reproduction of the probabilistic nature of the errors of CMM forms a cloud of possible measurement results used to obtain the required estimate of the measurement error. The carried out experimental researches have shown influence of such sources of errors on the accuracy of the coordinate measuring machine operation as positioning errors along the measuring axes, their curvature and mutual non-perpendicularity, and the deflection of the measuring probe. The proposed model for estimating the measurement error can be used to select the layout of the measuring machine, which has the best accuracy at a given cost.

This paper sets out the method of improving the accuracy of mechatronic systems used for measurements of complex geometry. At the core of this method is a programmed compensation of systematic errors (inaccuracies) of mechatronic systems. The difference of the proposed method from the existing solutions is that this method employs three relatively simple reference gauges: cylindrical, flat, and spherical. The methodology suggests measuring the reference gauges, calculating the compensation parameters and their subsequent accounting when deriving the results of measurements. The parameters of compensation of systemic errors are defined on the basis of the results of measurements of the said reference gauges of surfaces in a mechatronic system.

The method may be applied for enhancement of the accuracy of measurements of mechatronic systems used in process-specific coordinate measurement machines.

In the first stage of filter procedure the inclination normals vector and two-dimensional haar wavelet transformation of the point coordinates array are used. In the second stage construction of the linear regression for the final filtration of form deviations is performed. The method increases precision of the results in comparison with traditional methods used by software for coordinate measurement.
Measuring instruments are integral parts of production process. Their accuracy and cost parameters influence the quality and prime cost of the products made. One of the most important tasks is a reasonable choice of the measuring instruments' usage for re-equipment of the existing or equipment of newly engineered production facilities. Control of details with compound shape is performed with the usage of specialized equipment, analog instruments or modern measuring mens that are supported by computer means. As a rule, the cost and the accuracy of modern measuring instruments that are supported by computer means are higher than that of the general instruments. That's why the question emerges, whether big investments to the measuing instruments would recover. In this work the model of a resonable choice of production measuring instruments is suggested, which considers their accuracy and cost parameters. Measuring instruments' accuracy is considered by means of modeling error I and error II occurrences. As a selection criterion we use general expenditures for control, which account for control performance and expenditures, connected with rejection of accepted parts or mistaken acceptance of unacceptable details as accepted ones. Production process' modeling is performed with the usage of the following models: "White noise", "Linear trend", "Fan process" and "Wiener process". In the course of modeling it was concluded that the usage of modern measuring instruments, characterized by high accuracy and high cost, is preferable.
Inclined gas–solid fluidized bed has excellent particle separation and purification performance. Hence, Z-shaped fluidized bed as a novel fluidization system is designed in this work. The effect of superficial gas velocity on the sorting behaviors of mixed biomass particles is investigated by using the computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method, and a high-speed fluidization image experiment platform is established. The density and elastic modulus of biomass particles are experimentally measured, and the shapes are characterized by sphericity. Detailed information (i.e., distribution behavior and flow velocity of particle and fluid, particle residence time, and particle force) are obtained and analyzed. Results show that particles and fluid phases are not uniformly distributed, and a core-annulus structure is observed. The mixed particles movement process is divided into rising, settling, resuspension, and separation. The predictions on the solid distribution and sorting behaviors in the fluidized bed agree well with the experimental findings. Given the different densities and sizes, clean products flow upward and impurities flow downwards when the inlet air velocity is 1.5 m/s. As the superficial gas velocity increases, the transport efficiency of mixed particles improves, but the separation degree decreases. Clean products and impurities are effectively separated under the optimal gas velocity of 1.5–2.5 m/s. Particles in the channel center have a good following performance, moving in a zigzag pattern with the fluid, but they tend to slide along the inclined wall. The dynamic forces of the mixed particles are influenced by the channel section area. These findings provide valuable insight into the development and optimization of particle purification appliances in multiphase reactors.
Tooth flank twist is a common phenomenon in the helical crowning modification of helical cylindrical gear, which reduces the performance of the gear. At present, the measurement of tooth flank twist is still in the stage of replacing surface with line. The development of 3-D measurement technology makes the acquisition of gear information more comprehensive and complete. By processing the 3-D point cloud data, the twist deviation on the tooth flank can be found, which is particularly important for improving the quality of the tooth flank. In this paper, a characterization method of tooth flank twist based on orthogonal polynomials was proposed, which can effectively separate the twist deviations existing on the tooth flank. The correctness of the method was verified by measurement experiments. Taking worm grinding wheel grinding to process helical crowning modification as an example, the model of various parameters of the gear and the amount of twist was established and the twist deviation in processing was predicted. This provides a new method for eliminating the twist deviation of the tooth flank.
In order to enhance the grinding performance of alumina ceramic materials, the surface of the grinding wheels is ablated by laser radiation before grinding, and the three types of leaf-vein bionic grinding wheels with different micro-groove pitches are formed to compare the grinding experiments with normal grinding wheels. The grinding forces and surface roughness were gauged and the morphological characteristics of ground workpiece surfaces were studied. The results showed that with the increase of groove pitch, the normal grinding force was reduced by 9.6–63%, while the tangential grinding force is reduced by 8.3–42%. The groove can promote the flow of coolant, accelerate the heat dissipation and chip removal in the grinding area and reduce the damage of the workpiece and the wear of the grinding wheel, so the vein bionic grinding wheel had more tremendous processing advantages. Among the four kinds of grinding wheels, the leaf-vein bionic grinding wheel with groove pitch equal to 8 mm obtained the best grinding effect. The vein-shaped groove had a positive impact on the grinding process.
Owing to the difficulty in processing and measuring large involute artifacts, the value transfer of large gears remains a challenge. In this study, by replacing the involute tooth profile with an arc, a new double-axis arc-shaped large-size involute artifact was constructed, and a design method for the artifact was proposed. In the newly designed large-size involute artifact, the diameter of the reference block was 181.7744 mm, and the distance from the center of the reference block to the axis of the centering axis was 362.1212 mm. The artifact was tested using the Klingelnberg Gear Measuring Center P100. Three performance indicators fVB, fFK and fNC are proposed to evaluate the gear measurement instrument. The experimental results demonstrated that the developed double-axis arc-shaped large-size involute artifact satisfied the high-precision requirements for the processing and inspection of artifacts. The paper provides theoretical support for establishing the value transfer and traceability system and the gear involute extension standard.
Silicon carbide ceramics are widely used in many industrial fields owing to their outstanding physical and chemical characteristics. However, their inherent hardness and brittleness make the grinding process very difficult compared to that involving ductile materials. In the present study, the effects of the biomimetic fractal-branched structure, inspired from the leaf-vein, on the grinding behavior of silicon carbide were investigated. Two biomimetic fractal-branched structures with different densities of micro-channels were designed and compared with the non-structured silicon carbide surface. The surface of the silicon carbide ceramic was textured through pulsed-laser ablation. Thereafter, the grinding experiment was conducted on the biomimetic fractal-branched and non-structured workpieces. The surface topography, subsurface damage, grinding force, grinding force ratio, surface roughness and grinding wheel wear were examined throughout the experiment. The experimental results indicated that the normal and tangential grinding forces for the fractal-branched structure surface are 7.61–18.21% and 8.34–26.13% lower than those for the non-structured surface. The grinding force ratio also increased significantly with an increase in the micro-channel density. In addition, a larger volume of coolant was transported through the grinding zone of the fractal-branched structure. The research results confirmed that the biomimetic fractal-branched structure on the silicon carbide surface enhanced the grinding performance and improved the grinding quality.
In order to further improve the bearing capacity of plastic gears in the transmission of metal worm and plastic helical gears, the force characteristics of the traditional equal-pitch worm helical gear meshing transmission were studied in depth, and the unequal pitch meshing of the worm and the helical gear was innovatively proposed. Based on beam bending theory and gear tooth deformation theory, the relationship between tooth surface load, deformation and contact stiffness is obtained.On the premise that the bending deformation rate of the gear tooth root is equal, the theoretical design method of unequal meshing is deduced, and the pitch adjustment of the worm in the case of unequal pitch meshing is obtained, which is verified by static strength experiments.The experimental results show that the unequal pitch design can increase the load-bearing capacity of the plastic helical gear by 13.69%.
With the continuous improvement of the theory and method of gear measurement, the effectiveness of gear contact measurement is reduced, making it difficult to meet the need for 100% gear detection. To improve the measurement efficiency and make effective use of the full tooth surface data, a gear pitch rapid measurement method by point laser sensor is proposed. This method studies the principle of measuring the gear based on a laser point sensor, and the efficient model of collection and analysis of tooth surface data is established. Then the evaluation of the pitch deviation is completed, including the individual single pitch deviation, the single pitch deviation, the individual cumulative pitch deviation, and the total cumulative pitch deviation. Additionally, the pitch deviation of the multiple cross-sections is investigated, which may characterize the overall pitch deviation of the tooth surface. Compared to the gear measuring center P26, the experimental results show that the optical measurement of pitch deviation is feasible and efficient. Depending on the different measuring conditions, the offset status of the sensor can be selected to meet the different efficiency and accuracy requirements. The research and application potential of a point laser sensor in gear measurement is wide-ranging.
There were two forces that promoted the development of gear measurement technology. One was the continuous new requirements for gear measurement put forward by industrial development, and the other was the penetration of continuously improving related technologies in the field of gear measurement. Since the 21st century, the convergence of these two forces promoted the rapid development of gear measurement technology. Based on a brief review of the evolution of gear accuracy theory and gear measurement technology in the 20th century, the basic framework of gear generalized accuracy theory was put forward. The gear measurement technology during the last 20 years was systematically summarized from the aspects of gear full-information measurement technology, in-site rapid gear sorting and detection technology, extreme measurement technology for extra-large gears and micro gears, high-precision gear artifacts and traceability, etc. There is more than 100 years since the beginning of gear precision measurement, and it is currently in the critical stage of the transition from the 3rd generation to the next-generation of gear measurement. The overall technical concept of next-generation of gear measurement was presented, the basic theory and key technical problems that must be overcome were listed for realizing the next-generation of gear measurement, and the research focus and scientific issues of gear measurement in the next 10 years were prospected.
A new set technology of precision worm gear pair was introduced herein. With the core idea of "error induced remodeling and self accurate offset", an intelligent iFMT instrument for mechanical transmission error detection was developed to realize the accurate detection of transmission errors. In order to realize the technology, a new worm gear mother machine embedded with iFMT instrument was developed, which may realize the integrated function of machining and measurement. Combined with cutting tools, new standards and supporting technologies, an ultra-precision worm gear pair with double side accuracies of DIN standard grade 1 was obtained finally.
In order to improve the accuracy of large-scale CMMs and correct spatial geometric errors, the laser tracing multi-station measurement method was used, instead of physical benchmark, to solve CMM geometric errors based on the elastic net algorithm. Based on laser tracing multi-station measurement, combined with L-M algorithm, the high-precision measurement of the volume errors of CMM space planning points was realized, and the measuring efficiency was improved. The elastic net algorithm was used to solve CMM quasi-rigid body model, and the problem of multicollinearity in the model solutions, and to realize the solution of geometric errors of the CMMs. The relationship model between volume errors and uniaxial geometric errors was combined with the part of coefficients of 0 in equations to solve geometric errors. In the experiments, a laser tracing multi-station measurement system was built, and the volume errors of the CMMs spatial planning points were measured. The results show that the method proposed herein may effectively solve the geometric errors of large-scale CMMs.
The combustion and fluidization behavior of biomass depend on the physical properties (size, morphology, and density) and mechanical performances (elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, tensile strength and failure strain), but their quantitative models have rarely been focused in previous researchers. Hence, a static image measurement for particle physical properties is studied. Combining the uniaxial tension and digital image correlation technology, the dynamic image measurement method for the mechanical properties is proposed. The results indicate that the average roundness, rectangularity, and sphericity of present biomass particles are 0.2, 0.4, and 0.16, respectively. The equivalent diameter and density obey the skewed normal distribution. The tensile strength and failure stress are sensitive to stretching rate, fiber size and orientation. The distribution intervals of elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio are 30–600 MPa and 0.25–0.307, respectively. The stress–strain curves obtained from imaging experiments agree well with the result of finite element method. This study provides the operating parameters for the numerical simulation of particles in the fluidized bed and combustor. Furthermore, the computer vision measurement method can be extended to the investigations of fossil fuels.
As the most widely used gear measuring instrument, the gear measuring center can measure the individual deviations of a gear tooth flank other than the comprehensive deviations of the gear. However, gear transmission error is an important transmission performance indicator in the gear meshing process. It is an important trend of gear measuring to obtain the transmission error from individual deviations. In this study, a calculation method of gear transmission error is proposed based on the point clouds of the gear obtained by optical sensors. According to the gear meshing principle, a method is introduced to determine the contact status between the tooth flanks formed by the point clouds. According to this introduced method, the single tooth pair meshing process and the meshing process of multiple tooth pairs are analyzed to determine the gear transmission error curve. The comparison results of tooth contact analysis and gear measurement experiments verify the proposed virtual measurement method.
The breakthrough of complex surface measurement technology makes the rapid acquisition of gear topology error a reality. For deeply digging into the 3-D information, the characterization and decomposition of 3-D deviations become basic problems of overall evaluating the gear accuracy and taking full advantage of measurements. The normal deviations of gear are mapped to the coordinate system of the plane of action. This manuscript completes the two-dimensionalization of the 3-D tooth flank basing on dimensional reduction technology and Legendre polynomials for building up the 3-D deviation characterization of the tooth flank. The relationship between the expansion coefficients of Legendre polynomials and the characteristic deviations of the tooth flanks has been illustrated to realize the decouple of characteristic errors. The experiment shows the effectiveness of Legendre polynomials in characterizing and decomposing the 3-D deviations, which provides theoretical foundation for gear 3-D big data analysis, overall evaluation of the gear accuracy, machining error traceability and performance prediction of gear pairs.
A profilometer can be used to monitor the tooth surface topography evolution during gear pitting tests. Due to the mounting relationship variation between the instrument and the gear, the tooth profile's measurement position deviation from its theoretical location will introduce a measurement error. In this study, the tooth profile measurement error introduced by mounting using a tactile profilometer was theoretically analysed and experimentally confirmed as a fish shape. A mounting error compensation method based on projection onto the perpendicular plane to the gear's datum axis was proposed. The results show that the fish-shaped tooth profile measurement error can be effectively compensated, benefitting the evaluation of the gear tooth surface wear during gear pitting tests.
Line-structured laser sensors used in gear measuring provide a new way to acquire the perfect 3-D information of the complicated tooth flank with modification. This method leads to a series of problems, such as incident light occlusion, multiple reflection, system calibration and so on. The incident light occlusion poses severe problem on the integrity of the gear flank data acquired by the line-structured laser sensors. To understand the influence of the incident light occlusion during the cylindrical gear measuring and improve the efficiency of the measurement, this article analyzes this problem in depth. According to the position relation between the line-structure laser sensor and the gear, the projection theory is used to illustrate the incident light occlusion process between adjacent teeth and the model of the occlusion is built up. Four experiments are conducted to verify the validity of the model. This model applies to the cylindrical gear with different parameters. The influence of the modification on incident light occlusion zone could be ignored. On the basis of this model, the influence of the offset and the setting angle of the sensor on the incident light occlusion problem is thoroughly discussed, which gives a guide to control route planning and data acquiring during measuring the perfect information of the tooth flank.
Using thermal-oxidative aging and tribological experiments, effects of thermal-oxidative aging processes on tribological properties of polyformaldehyde (POM) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) were evaluated and compared with each other. It was found that the color of UHMWPE surface after aging has turned to yellow, while that of POM surface has no obvious change. The aging factors lead to dimensional change of UHMWPE disk specimens from the original circle to the ellipse in the meantime. Tribological experiments show that friction coefficients of the pairs of POM/GCr15 and UHMWPE/GCr15 tend to decrease after thermal-oxidative aging, and the decreasing tendency in friction coefficients of POM/GCr15 is more distinct. The results of this study will contribute to the understanding of the relationship between aging and tribological properties of POM and UHMWPE, and enrich the theory of polymer tribology.
We adopted a topological optimization theory to solve issues involving balance weights in pitching platforms of laser tracing measurement systems, which cannot reach required masses in a finite volume. This theory was used to optimize the lightweight mechanical structure of connecting plates and the lifting frames of pitching platforms. Stress analysis was performed on a model that was reconstructed via topology optimization using code from reference [17]. Simulation results showed that the weight of the optimized mechanical structure of the pitching platform was reduced by 1.65 kg, with a weight reduction of 55.7%. After optimization, the weight of the pitch frame was reduced by 0.628 kg, with a weight reduction of 27.9%, and the weight of the counterweight was reduced from 7.8 kg to 4.6 kg using the same volume and material. This proposed method effectively solves the contradiction between the volume and mass of the counterweight toward a lightweight mechanical structure in laser tracking measurement systems.
Compared with contact measurement, machine vision inspection, a noncontact measurement, has the advantages of high efficiency, complete information, good stability, and recognizable defects. It has been used increasingly in the field of gear inspection. Many gear inspection instruments based on machine vision technology have been developed in the last 10 years, including video measuring machines, flash measuring machines, CVGM instruments, and online inspection equipments that can perform both comprehensive gear inspection and analytical gear measurement. This paper examines the development processes and characteristics of gear visual inspection instruments; analyzes the research and application progress of algorithms such as edge detection, subpixel positioning, feature extraction, and pattern recognition in gear visual inspection; summarizes the technical development of machine vision in gear accuracy measurement and gear defect inspection; and identifies the future development prospects of gear visual inspection instruments and technology.
When a milling tool is used to mill small modulus copper electrode gears (SMCEG), the deformation is inevitable, thus leading to the helix slope deviation (HSD) of copper electrode gears (CEG). To compensate the influence of milling tool deflection (MTD) on the HSD, a universal HSD compensation model was established for different sizes of milling tools. First, using the principle of orthogonal experiment, a linear regression model of milling parameters and milling tool radius is established. Secondly, the average value of the HSD obtained by the gear measuring instrument is converted into the maximum of MTD according to the principle of helix line formation. The maximum deflections of the milling tools are used as the response value of the regression analysis to fit the maximum deflection curve of the milling tool. Through the reverse adjustment of the rotation angle of the rotating motor, the HSD compensation is realized. Finally, the model was verified by the milling tests. The results showed that the helix deviation reached the requirements of level 4 to 5 in GB/T 38192-2019, and proved the correctness of the established MTD model. The model is significant for milling SMCEG.
While cycloid pin-wheel precision reducers (referred to as RV reducers) are widely used in industrial robots, a widely accepted design standard or verification method of their test platforms is not available. In this study, a comprehensive sliding-separation test platform of RV reducers was developed. The test platform can test various measurement items such as transmission error, static measurement of lost motion, dynamic measurement of lost motion, torsional rigidity, no-load running torque, starting torque, backdriving torque, and transmission efficiency of the RV reducer for robots. The principle and method of dynamic measurement of lost motion tests based on the two-way transmission error method were studied and this test function was successfully integrated with the comprehensive test platform in order to increase the test items of the dynamic performance parameters of RV reducers. The measurement results of the no-load running torque of the RV reducer were consistent with the Stribeck curve. Based on the concept of optimal measurement speed, a decomposition test method of the geometric component of the dynamic measurement of lost motion and the elastic component of the dynamic measurement of lost motion was proposed in the dynamic measurement test of lost motion. Through precision calibration, function test and repeatability test, the results were compared with the data of enterprise’s samples. The consistent results have proved that the test platform met engineering requirements and measurement accuracy requirements. Based on the new test principle, the developed platform can test more parameters of RV reducers with high precision and display the comprehensive test performance.
A suspension-type small vehicle has the significant advantages of high efficiency, convenience and environmental protection due to its flexible scheduling and compact vehicle structure, but its narrow available space also limits ride comfort. Due to the influences of various factors, such as a large lateral force applied on the steering arm, a large centrifugal force and a large crosswind force, the guide wheel and track side may be subjected to a large impact, so that passengers’ ride comfort becomes worse. In this study, first, The swing mechanism of side force on suspension vehicle is analyzed, the theoretical model of vertical load reallocation between left and right wheels of vehicles under the lateral force on the steering arm, centrifugal force and crosswind load is established to analyze the influences of vertical load reallocation of left and right wheels on tire cornering stiffness and steady-state response. Then, based on the improved distributed double-bogie 8-hub motor driving mode, with the minimum displacement amount of the displacement sensor and the minimum roll angle of the vehicle as the optimization targets. The PID closed-loop control strategy is constructed by processing the data of guide wheel displacement sensor and vehicle gyroscope with Kalman filter to realize the closed-loop adaptive control of vehicle driving attitude. Then, the anti-interference ability of the classical PID control strategy is improved by introducing the fuzzy control into the PID control and the robustness of the system is improved by modifying the controller parameters in real time. Finally, the driving states of the vehicle are experimentally compared under three control modes: non-PID control, PID closed-loop control and fuzzy PID control. In addition, the ride comfort is evaluated to verify the control algorithm. The experimental results showed that the roll angle and lateral acceleration of the suspension-type small rail vehicle based on the fuzzy PID control system were significantly improved and the anti-interference ability and the stability of the vehicle were also largely enhanced. The study provides the basis for improving ride comfort of suspension-type small rail vehicles.
Double helical gears are widely applied in the aviation, marine and energy equipment, and generally required to be modified as the crowned since the machining error and assembling error of the gear drive are inevitable. The crowned gears usually operate in point contact mixed elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), and adhesive wear has been one of the most prominent problems, but few previous researches were focused on this problem. In this work, a wear life prediction model of crowned double helical gears in point contact mixed EHL is proposed. The tooth profiles of the crowned gears are obtained according to the generating principle, and the load is attained in consideration of multi-tooth pairs contact. The contact pressure is derived from Hertzian elastic contact theory and load sharing concept, and the sliding distance is determined by a generalized model. Then, the wear rate in point contact mixed EHL is evaluated by extending the Archard theory to lubricated case, and the extended Archard's wear model is used to formulate the gear tooth wear. Moreover, the wear life prediction model which takes account of rotation speed and input torque is established, and the influences of surface roughness and crowned amount on the wear life of the crowned gears are further studied. Results show that surface roughness has a great influence on the wear life at different rotational speeds, while input torque has a great influence on the wear life at different crowned amount. It indicates that the wear life of the crowned double helical gears can be improved by reasonable matching lubrication, modification and working parameters.
Minimizing the mass and moment of inertia is a crucial objective in robot design. Especially for the biped humanoid robots, leg mass and moment of inertia severely affect the robot’s ultimate speed, motion stability, and interaction safety. The lightweight design for the legs of biped humanoid robots has been a hot but difficult research topic in recent decades. This paper will propose a new optimization approach for achieving lightweight design of biped humanoid robot legs. Firstly, the joint drivetrain dynamic model will be established, followed by the process of determining the selection criteria of motors and gearbox, and clarifying the calculation method of joint mass attributes. Secondly, the minimal total mass of the robot’s legs is taken as the goal to optimize, and the parameters related to the motor and gearbox models are the design variables. As the robot walks stably, the maximal walking speed that is close to the target speed is regarded as the constraint. A complex method is then implemented in a commercial mathematical software, the model to simulate robot dynamics is established in commercial dynamic software, and the dynamic simulation is completed using the three-dimensional linear inverted pendulum gait planning method. Finally, the Walker robot is used as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design optimization approach. The results show that the design optimization method can significantly reduce the total mass of the robot’s legs, reduce the torque requirements of the robot’s leg joints, and improve the stability of the robot’s motion. The optimization approach presented in this study is also important and applicable to the lightweight design of other categories of robots.
According to the structure characteristics and motion principle of traditional machine tools, the spiral bevel gear is virtual machined by Catia. By comparing the machining accuracy with the theoretical model, the rationality and accuracy of the modeling are proved. Hypermesh is used to mesh the gears, which is imported into ABAQUS for finite element analysis to extract the curve of transmission error and contact wire with the increase of load, the amplitude of transmission error fluctuation decreases, but the amplitude of deviation from zero line increases. It shows that the transmission of spiral bevel gear is more stable and the transmission accuracy decreases with the increase of load, which is consistent with the dynamic characteristics of spiral bevel gear, indicating that the performance of virtual machining gear is good. When the contact performance and transmission error curve of the gear formed by virtual machining are not ideal in the finite element analysis, according to the principle of modification, the machining parameters can be adjusted and gear is reprocessed in Catia. The contact and transmission performance of the reconstructed gear can be improved in the analysis. In Catia simulation machining, the error can be added artificially to provide a model for the finite element analysis of the gear with error, which is convenient for people to study the dynamic characteristics of the gear with error. In the gear design stage, the finite element method is used to study the contact performance and transmission characteristics of the gear, so as to predict and evaluate the quality of the virtual machining gear, analyze the relationship between the gear performance and the adjustment parameters of the machine tool, and play an important role in the reverse adjustment of the processing adjustment parameters of the spiral bevel gear.
This study presents an accurate and robust method for fitting noisy and occlusion elliptic data. The nonlinear issue of ellipse fitting is interpreted as a set of Levenberg–Marquardt iterations (LMIs) by minimizing the geometric distance. For each iteration of the geometric fitting, the representations of the parameterized ellipses are mapped to the geometric error distances, which are implemented latently by an orthogonal angle segmentation of the ellipses. Moreover, dimension reduction is utilized by the LMIs to avoid misconvergence and expensive computations. The method based on two recent representative algorithms is verified by simulation and real-world experiments. The results suggest that the saliency capability of the new method to fit ellipse-specific profiles with severe noise and occlusion, which is better than or equal to those of the reference approaches, has potential applications in quality monitoring, three-dimensional reconstruction, and instrument calibration.
Actuators are key components of biped humanoid robots; hence, their technological development directly affects the development of such robots. This paper reviews the origin and history of the actuator, analyzes the motion characteristics of the biped humanoid robot, and proposes the core technical indicators of the biped humanoid robot's actuator. Then, it discusses the technical development of stiffness actuator, series elastic actuator, and proprioceptive actuator. The structure, control, power, and application characteristics of the three actuators are also compared. Studying the highly integrated actuator with the animal's leg bone and muscle system as reference is a new research direction in the principle of actuators. The next development trends for existing actuator technology are the standardization of testing methods and performance indicators of stiffness actuators, elastic actuators integrated with the robot's overall configuration, motion control algorithms for system-level optimization, and technological innovations on the encoders of proprioceptive actuators.
An improved active disturbance rejection control (I-ADRC) to improve the disturbance attenuation of a permanent magnet synchronous motor speed controller was proposed in this paper. A nonlinear function with improved smoothness was adopted to design the controller. The Lyapunov stability of the improved tracking differentiator, the improved extended state observer, and the controller were analysed. Moreover, simulations and experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The results demonstrate that the proposed controller has a smaller steady-state error and a stronger disturbance attenuation ability than the proportional integral derivative (PID) controller.
Longitudinal-crowned involute helical gears perform better in load capacity and can improve transmission quality. When longitudinal crowning of helical gears is processed with continuous generating grinding, the flank twist occurs and reduces the transmission stability of gears. In the paper, an innovative approximation model is proposed to demonstrate the relationships between the flank twist and parameters (including gear parameters and modification parameters) in a simple mathematical form. The flank twist calculated by the approximation model is compared with that calculated based on the gear meshing principle. The comparison results confirm that the model is right. Based on the new model, the influences of gear parameters on the flank twist are analyzed. The model can reduce the flank twist in the gear design.
Milling has the characteristics of flexibility and versatility, and can largely reduce the production cycle of customized tools. This study aims to mill helical surfaces of uniform roughness with universal tools in four-axis CNC machine tools through designing the optimal milling path. The transverse profile of the involute gear is modeled by the analytical method and the equidistant profile of the transverse profile is established by using the principle of normal offset to provide a theoretical tool position for tool paths. Aiming at the problem of unequal adjacent line spacing generated in the determination of the number of feed lines based on a constant angle, a determination method of the number of feed lines based on a constant arc length is proposed. In this method, according to the principle of calculus, the arc length of the involute curve is calculated to determine the proper number of feed lines which allows the scallop height to be approximately uniformly distributed on the tooth surface. In milling experiments, the processing efficiencies of LRTSLBL milling and LRTSTBT milling were confirmed and the peak of pitch under a small volume of tool wear was avoided by LRTSLBL milling. Importantly, the skip tooth machining test by LRTSTBT milling confirmed the cause for pitch peak and provided the basis for pitch error compensation.
The feature lines on involute surface include profile, helix, normal meshing profile and contact line. In helical gear transmission, the deviation of normal meshing tooth shape can reflect the transmission quality of gear better. In this paper, a method is proposed to obtain the tooth flank normal deviation from the 3D measuring point cloud data of gear, and to obtain the normal meshing profile deviation curve from it, and to evaluate it.
In this study, a new type of self-lubricating nanoparticle diamond grinding wheel with MoS2 and TiO2 nanoparticles as filling materials was proposed. According to the macro parameters (grinding force) and micro parameters (surface roughness, surface morphology, grinding wheel wear), the lubricated characteristic on tool and workpiece surface with various concentrations of nanoparticles was studied. The research indicated that the composite nanoparticles can effectively improve the lubricated characteristic of the tool. The nanoparticles released from the grinding wheel can participate in lubrication and decrease the adhesion of abrasive grains to the workpiece surface, so as to enhance the surface quality of the workpiece. Moreover, there is a suitable addition range of composite nanoparticles in the grinding wheel. Adding too little or exceeding this range will weaken the friction reduction performance of the nanoparticles. It had the best lubrication performance and surface quality of the workpiece at a nanoparticle volume concentration of 8%.
The center of the mandrel-target is unique and does not get affected by the extrinsic angle of the projector. On this basis, a mandrel-target-based method is described to simultaneously calibrate the extrinsic parameters and the turntable of a multi-axis, structured-light-sensor-integrated, three-dimensional (3-D) scanning system. Besides, a cross-section-arc algorithm is developed to identify the conjugate pair. By computing the mandrel-center in the light plane, some collinear scanning points are generated along with the spindle scanning. Further, these calibration points are employed to the tip-tilt self-calibration of the turntable. In the two-scanning strategy, three sets of non-colinear points are derived simultaneously by relatively moving the sensor at distinct world coordinates. These generated points are fulfilled to calibrate the extrinsic parameters with the relative motion model. By determining the direction vectors, the skewed sensor coordinates are converted into the Cartesian world coordinates. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using a set of experiments. The accuracy of the proposed model is justified by comparing it with the measurements of a CMM trigger probe. The absolute measurement accuracy for a mandrel-target (about 7.4827 mm in radius and 16 mm in depth) is 0.002 mm. The target is cost-effective and simple in shape. The calibration procedure is easy to carry out and highly accurate.
Accuracy measurement is an essential front step to error compensation of industrial robots. Different measurement methods have been tried all the way over the past years. In this paper, we propose a novel method to measure the positioning distance accuracy based on the multi-station technology of the laser tracer device. Compared with the laser tracker device, this method is more precise in measuring the coordinate values of the robot end-effector. Besides, the laser tracer is more portable than the laser tracker. At the last part, a practical example is presented in which we have carried out in an domestic industrial robot.
Aiming at the problems of overshoot, weak disturbance resistance ability and poor adaptive ability of permanent magnet synchronous motor using PI control algorithm. Firstly, the field oriented control (FOC) model of permanent magnet synchronous motor is analyzed. Secondly, based on the active disturbance rejection control and fuzzy control principle, the speed loop controller is improved, and the fuzzy active disturbance rejection control algorithm is designed. The control algorithm preserves the advantages of active disturbance rejection control, and realizes the online tuning function of active disturbance rejection control parameters, which improves the adaptive ability of the system. Finally, the simulation experiment is carried out on the MATLAB / Simulink platform, and the results show that the fuzzy active disturbance rejection control algorithm has the characteristics of no overshoot, high control accuracy and strong adaptive ability.
Robot joint is the main actuator for the attitude control of robot system, which has an important effect on the performance of the whole machine. Lost motion is the key indices to characterize robot joint transmission accuracy and performance, and its measurement and evaluation is an important foundation for robot joint performance improvement. The measurement level of robot joint lost motion is still limited to the measurement of single transmission device, such as reducer and motor. The researches on measuring robot joint lost motion is still small. This paper analyzes the measuring principle and methods of robot joint lost motion, and designs a testing machine for robot joint, which provides a strong support for establishing the overall quality evaluation system for robot joint. The correctness, effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method and theory have been verified by targeted experiments. It shows that the testing machine can meet the requirements of measuring lost motion of different types of robot joints.
Due to its anisotropic shrinkage characteristics and the instability of forming process, small module plastic gears are easy to produce complex appearance defects after forming. The traditional manual detection can not accurately identify all kinds of defects, let alone complete the full inspection and statistical analysis. Therefore, a prototype of small module plastic gear on-line detection and sorting system based on machine vision is developed. The system has the function of on-line classification and identification of plastic gear surface defects, and can realize full inspection. The watershed algorithm based on local extreme value and Canny edge extraction algorithm can accurately extract the gear defect area, mark the defect location and count the defect characteristics, complete the determination of defects such as size out of tolerance, shrinkage, burr, surface foreign matter and incompletely filled part in 0.3s, and display the defect location through the human-computer interaction interface, with a discrimination accuracy of 95%.
Surface roughness has an important influence on the service performance and life of parts. Areal surface roughness has the advantage of accurately and comprehensively characterizing surface microtopography. Understanding the relationship and distinction between profile and areal surface roughness is conducive to deepening the study of areal surface roughness and improving its application. In this paper, the concepts, development, and applications of surface roughness in the profile and the areal are summarized from the aspect of evaluation parameters. The relationships and differences between surface roughness in the profile and the areal are analyzed for each aspect, and future development trends are identified.
Tool wear is an important factor that affects the quality and machining accuracy of aeronautical structural parts in the milling process. It is essential to monitor the tool wear in titanium alloy machining. The traditional tool wear features such as root mean square (RMS), kurtosis, and wavelet packet energy spectrum are related to not only the tool wear status but also to the milling parameters, thus monitoring the tool wear status only under fixed milling parameters. This paper proposes a new method of online monitoring of tool wear using milling force coefficients. The instantaneous cutting force model is used to extract the milling force coefficients which are independent of milling parameters. The principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is used to fuse the milling force coefficients. Furthermore, support vector machine (SVM) model is used to monitor tool wear states. Experiments with different machining parameters were conducted to verify the effectiveness of this method used for tool wear monitoring. The results show that compared to traditional features, the milling force coefficients are not dependent on the milling parameters, and using milling force coefficients can effectively monitor the transition point of cutters from normal wear to severe wear (tool failure).
High efficiency milling is one of the main goals of CNC machining. Although roughing operation has low requirement for machining accuracy, the milling parameter selection usually need to consider the cutting force, milling stability, spindle torque and power. Besides, the tool wear in difficult-to-cut material machining is another very prominent problem. Therefore, how to achieve the high efficient milling parameters under the multi-constraint condition has been a severe challenge in the field of CNC machining. In this paper, a milling parameter optimization method for efficient rough machining is proposed by combining the off-line optimization and real-time monitoring. Firstly, a mathematical model of the optimization problem is established, which takes the machining efficiency as the objective, the spindle speed, radial and axial depth of cuts as the variables, and considers the multi-constraint, such as the basic parameter feasible region, cutting force, stability, spindle torque and power. Secondly, the quantitative relationship between the spindle three-phase current and milling force is established to realize the real-time estimation of cutting force coefficients. Furthermore, a numerical optimization method based on the random vector search is proposed, and the overall optimization procedure is given. Finally, a series of experimental verifications on the titanium alloy Ti5Al5Mo5VCrFe machining has been carried out, and the case study results show that the proposed parameter optimization method can greatly improve the machining efficiency, which proves the validity of the method.
This paper presents a tool wear prediction model based on multi-sensorial data fusion, which integrates both local preserving projection (LPP) and support vector regression machine (SVR). The time-domain features are extracted from spindle current and feed motor torque signals, and the multi-sensorial features are fused by three dimension reduction algorithms of PCA, KPCA and LPP. To compare the fusion effect, SVR model was used to establish the mapping relationship between the fusion feature and the tool flank wear value, and the tool wear value was predicted. The experimental results demonstrate that the effect of feature fusion using LPP method is better than that of PCA and KPCA. In addition, in order to eliminate the motor current fluctuation and unexpected factors in cutting process, wavelet packet transform (WPT) algorithm is used to filter the extracted features to further improve the accuracy of tool wear prediction.
Saccharicoccus sacchari (Cockerell, 1895) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is globally disseminated on sugarcane plants. In Brazil, this species has been occurred in the same region as the occurrence of the fungal pathogen causing red rot, Colletotrichum falcatum Went, 1893 (Glomerellales). The objective of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that this pseudococcid could act as a facilitator of the penetration of the phytopathogen C. falcatum. Species of this mealybug were reared at laboratory to infest sugarcane plants during the experiment. A total of 320 sugarcane plants were utilized for this study, 160 of CTC4 and 160 of RB86 7515 cultivars (cv.), each group subdivided into four treatments: (1) infested with mealybugs; (2) infected with fungal conidia; (3) infested with mealybugs and infected with fungal conidia; and (4) control. Biometrics of the plants, disease symptoms, Total Reducing Sugars (TRS) and Reducing Sugar (RS) were evaluated. To both cv., there was no difference in the height and diameter of the plants in all treatments; and only in “mealybug + fungus”, significant difference on the lengths of the disease lesions inside the plants was found to each cv. as well as the levels of TRS and RS. The presence of the pseudococcid increased the incidence of the disease in both cv., although RB86 7515 was more susceptible to red rot than CTC4.
In missions that require robotic vehicles operating with a high level of autonomy, the coordination and the tasks assigned for each vehicle play a crucial role. In this work, we present a coordination control strategy applied in a searching scenario of oceanographic research buoys taking into account the problem of communication constraints. The proposed control strategy include the assignment of two different teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that search and acquire data from buoys with unknown locations in complex coastal or remote oceanic regions. We present a 3-layer architecture that search for the buoys, enables communication with them, and creates a UAV communication network with a quality-of-service scheme to recover the data. Extensive simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed coordinated control strategy.
Deploying a large number of sensing buoys is a powerful tool for oceanographic, marine biology and climate change research. In this work we address the problem of efficient data collection by a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) from low-power, small buoys with previously unknown locations in complex coastal or remote oceanic regions with aerial restrictions. To tackle this problem we propose and develop a 3-layers architecture that search for the buoys, enables communication with them and creates a UAV communication network to recover the data. Extensive simulations show that the proposed work both optimizes the searching area coverage path planning for complex regions and the quality-of-service for the data transmission from the buoys to the final destination using UAVs as relay nodes.
The use of multiple heterogeneous, low-cost, small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a tool in several application domains is becoming increasingly important. One critical aspect to enable the use of such vehicles is the coordination/planning system, whose task complexity increases with the number of vehicles and the communications constraints that arise due to their small size and large distances. In this work, we propose a control architecture for a platoon of relay UAVs that are independent of the coordination system. The platoon task consists in interconnecting the communication link between the possibly mobile command station and a UAV in a mission. The relays are actively driven to deploy, create a network and maintain a desired Quality-of-Service (QoS) level, defined in this paper. We present an architecture that is composed by a waypoint generator based on the network QoS and a Time Coordinated Path Following (TCPF) controller with a method to reduce the frequency of information exchange between the relay UAVs, through the use of a self-triggered control strategy. Exploiting this architecture, it is possible to plan a mission operation for a UAV without the need of considering vehicle-to-command-station communication constraints that will be satisfied by the introduction of the relay-UAVs platoon. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the developed strategy. The self-triggered approach results in significant reduction of information exchange between the relay UAVs, while maintaining the user desired network QoS.
One important aspect that needs to be carefully considered in maritime operations using unmanned robotic vehicles is the communication restrictions between the vehicles and the mission controller that arises mainly due to long distances and/or low power transmissions. This paper addresses the problem of maintaining a communication link between a command station and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with limited communication range during maritime operations. The proposed scheme uses an additional UAV that acts as a relay for the communication between the command station and the UAV in mission and is actively driven to maintain a desired Quality-of-Service (QoS) level, defined in this paper. Exploiting this architecture, it is possible to plan a maritime operation for a robotic vehicle without the need of considering vehicle-to-command-station communication constraints that will be satisfied by the introduction of the extra autonomous relay-UAVs. To this end, we propose a feedback strategy that has the dual task of commanding and optimizing the execution of the relay UAV motion tasks and adapting the scheduler algorithm according to a desired QoS level. The performance of the proposed strategy is illustrated through computer simulations and preliminary experimental results.
This paper presents an aerial manipulator consisting of a multirotor equipped with a robotic multi-link arm attached to the top of the multirotor body. This setup has strong potentialities for inspection of structures, since the arm is able to safely touching the structure surface with a sensor while flying, taking measurements from the underside for example in bridges. The paper presents the dynamic model of the system and the derivation of a nonlinear controller, which is tested in simulation. First flight experiments with prototype of the system are also presented.
This paper presents the design and control of a multirotor-based aerial manipulator developed for outdoor operation. The multi-rotor has eight rotors and large payload to integrate a 7-degrees of freedom arm and to carry sensors and processing hardware needed for outdoor positioning. The arm can also carry an end-effector and sensors to perform different missions. The paper focuses on the control design and implementation aspects. A stable backstepping-based controller for the multirotor that uses the coupled full dynamic model is proposed, and an admittance controller for the manipulator arm is outlined. Several experimental tests with the aerial manipulator are also presented. In one of the experiments, the performance of the pitch attitude controller is compared to a PID controller. Other experiments of the arm controller following an object with the camera are also presented.
